We plan to make an android app to get information about womens'participation in election to the Lok Sabha.

The idea is to make an android app that has user registration-login feature, uses facial recognition(using Mobile Vision API) and fingerprint authentication(using BiometricPrompt API) to confirm voters' identities. Blockchain is then used for securely storing votes in an immutable distributed ledger(Customer Lockbox). All the biometric data and passwords collected during online registration is used by Blockchain to match a voter with her identity in the dataset:
